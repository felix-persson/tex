# LaTeX Boilerplate
My personal LaTeX boilerplate for writing reports and note-taking.

It contains styles that you often see in math textbooks. Some environments are
framed (e.g. definitions, theorems, and lemmas), and those that are not (e.g.
examples and remarks) end with a QED-like symbol such as a diamond or a black
square. Proofs end with a hollow square.

Swedish is supported.

I also keep my bibliography here for convenience.
